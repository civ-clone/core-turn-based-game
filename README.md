# core-turn-based-game

This repo stores the core concept of a `Turn` and some basic `Rule`s and events around the `Start` and `End` of the 
turn. This is the basis for a turn-based game. Packages like `civ1-player` utilise these to allow a `Player` to perform
their actions, before ending the `Player`'s turn and then the game turn.
